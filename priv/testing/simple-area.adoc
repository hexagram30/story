= The MUSH Room

[default=true]
== Content

You are in a large, low-lit, warm room. The floor and walls are soft but firm,
with a bit of a bounce. There is a distinctive odor about the place. The only
features of interest seem to be some sort of structure in the center of the
room. Oh, and the trap down next to you.
