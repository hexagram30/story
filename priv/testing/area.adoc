= Cavern Great Room

[default=true]
== Content

You are in a large, almost completely dark cavern. 

[time=day]
== Content

There is one slight hint of light to the north which you believe to be the exit from this system of caves.

[time=night]
== Content

In fact, no "almost" about it. It is pitch black in here.

[attribute=perception,threshold=+3]
== Content

Against all odds, you detect something interesting here: by listening for echos and shuffling around, you manage to bump into a treasure chest.
